# ðŸŽ¶ YouTube-Style Music Player

A custom music player built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, inspired by a YouTube tutorial â€” but redesigned to be fully responsive and packed with thoughtful UI refinements. This project was my way of learning how music players are structured and adding small but important details I notice in real apps.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview
This project helped me understand how playlists, play/pause logic, and dynamic UI updates work. While the tutorial provided the base concept, I made it mobile-friendly and added practical improvements like button feedback, better song switching, and clean layout handling.

## âœ¨ Features
- Responsive layout â€” works smoothly on both desktop and mobile
- Dynamic playlist â€” songs generated directly from an array
- Play / Pause toggle with icon updates
- Next / Previous controls with edge-case handling (dimming inactive buttons)
- Background image updates â€” poster changes to match the current song
- Interactive footer buttons with subtle visual feedback
- Custom hover & tap animations for better user experience
- Clean scrollable playlist section that auto-adjusts on small screens

## ðŸš€ Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Place your songs in the Songs/ folder and cover images in Images/.
3. Update script.js with your playlist details if needed.
4. Open index.html in your browser and enjoy!

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- Managing DOM events to control playback
- Building fully responsive web layouts using flex and media queries
- Adding UI polish (hover states, tap feedback, button disabling)
- Structuring clean project files for scalability

## ðŸ™Œ Acknowledgements
- Inspiration: YouTube tutorial on how music players work
- Improvements & Code: Done by me â€” made responsive, added playback refinements, and polished the UI
